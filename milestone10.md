Write out an elevator pitch in the format of Heilmeier’s Catechism with a section for each of these questions, and then your answers (rest of the questions are optional, just do these 4 for milestone10.md):

**1. What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.**
We are trying to allow people to connect with others around them who are willing to help or who need help. We want those who want help to do so without any forms of judgement because it is essentially a stranger. Also, those that want to help people will be able to do so with our app by being there to listen to others.

**2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?**
It's currently done today by other social media websites: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Reddit, etc.
Those sites already have the features of user interaction with each other (commenting, messaging, profile system). The limits of current practice is the relative unchanging of core features. For example, facebook looks and functions at the core very similarly as it did 10 years ago. They've made incremental improvements over the years but the core feature of making and comenting posts on a user feed feed is the same.

**3. What’s new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?**
By having the location feature, we differentiate ourselves by encouraging and coordinating quick, real-life user encounters (as opposed to purely online interactions). Furthermore, we focused our app to be "feeling"-centric. This allows users to have an immediate gauge of the temperature people are feeling when they encounter each other. This furthermore breaks the ice for first encounters by giving a topic of discussion the user(s) are interested in talking about on the spot.


**4. Who cares? If you’re successful, what difference will it make?**
I think besides connecting people and giving help to people who need help around them, it will also change the way people using social networking apps because in the app people can interact directly with others people on map, discover about the places and discuss about what happening around these locations with the local people who actually live there.
