**Description of what pieces of feedback that you took from classmates and your TA to settle on this idea:**
* Make sure the users are genuine and not trolls. Some sort of screening process?
* Make sure to hone in on geographical relevance. Find nearby peers to meet up using a local map view.
* “How might locality influence the help people give and receive?”

**Description of your proposed project's features. (Can include UI sketches)**
* Allow users to find nearby peers, with similar interests/experiences?
* Maybe some filter when looking for peers to specify whether taking similar courses or sharing similar interests is important or not.
* Users can post their location and whether they are looking for help or looking to help others. Their post can include a little blurb about their immediate issue/problem.
* Users can have a profile tab and a map tab to post and find others nearby.
* Map view of people looking for help, their locations marked by a emotion face icon. I.e. (^_^) (-_-)
