**Description of how this feature has improved since Milestone 5:**
Since Milestone 5, our application has developed a consistent UI theme across our platform. Furthermore, we added important content with respect to the feedback we received in class including users being able to post anonymously, user selected prefered modes of contact, and timestamps on posts. We have also included a Edit Profile tab and Create Post tab where in the latter users can modify their account information and create posts that will be displayed on the map, respectively.
