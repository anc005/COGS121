**Description of how this feature has improved since Milestone 7:**
Since milestone 7, we now have a Profile page for the user, uniform UI across all pages. Users can now create posts that will capture their status message and location data. Our database implementation allows for persistent storage meaning posts made by other users can now be seen by anyone else.
